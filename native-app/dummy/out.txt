(Henderson & Srinivasan, 2009), and higher percentages being reported in other studies,

including 14% (Sienknecht, Friedrich, Martinka, & Friedenbach, 1904) to 18% (Douceur &
Bolosky, 1999). Empty folders may be made, for example, by putting nothing in them at
the point of their creation, perhaps in anticipation of forthcoming projects Kamaruddin.
Dix, and Martin, 2006; Khoo et al, 2007, or by not deleting them when the last file or
folder is removed. Users thus appear to differ widely regarding most FM actions; what they
seem to have in common, however, is a lack of reliance on soft file linking features such as
aliases in Mac, shortcuts in Windows, and symlinks in Linux (Gongalves & Jorge, 2003:
Ravasio et al., 2004). Nonetheless, different approaches or strategies to organising have
been identified among the varied findings, albeit rather broadly, so that we can describe
organisers as: neat or messy (Boardman & Sasse, 2004), prone to saving or deleting
(Berlin, Jeffries, O'Day, Pacpcke, & Wharton, 1993), and prone to filing or piling (Malone
1983), extensive filing or single folder filing (Henderson &

inivasan, 2011), or mixing
approaches (Trullemans & Signer, 2014a). To draw conclusions beyond these, studies are

needed with commensurable contexts, participant characteristics, file system measures, and
results reporting (Dineen, Odoni, Frissen, & Julien, 2016),

Retrieving. Retrieving files and folders may be done to find them for the first time

(eg in a shared drive) or to return to them (Dumais et al., 2016); returni

to an item is

also called refindi

and is distinct from simply finding an item again because the user has

additional information about their existence and location and thus may have additional

retrieval methods available (Capra, Pinney, & Perez-Quinones, 2005). Specifically

retrieving can be done manually, for example by navigating through the folder hierarchy to
a file's location, or by searching, for example by file property, keyword, or tag label. Both
approaches to retrieval require remembering something about the object to be retrieved.
such as its location, name, or other properties.

Much FM research has been motivated by understanding navigation and comparing it
with search, typically by examining users’ behaviour and preferences and their influences.
A preference for navigating to files is much more common than a preference for searching
(Fitchett & Cockburn, 2015; Song & Ling, 2011), even among users who prefer to search
rather than navigate folders when retrieving their emails (W. Jones, Wenning, & Bruce,
2014). There are numerous potential causes for this; users report that they feel desktop
search tools are too complicated (Ravasio et al., 2004), the search results are too numerous
and not meaningfully ranked (Fitchett & Cockburn, 2015), and that navigating through
folders provides important reminding cues about their collections (Barrean & Nardi, 1995)

These reports are reflected in users’ behaviour: users perform navigation far more
than searching (Bergman, Beyth-Marom, Nachmias, Gradovitch, & Whittaker, 2008
Fitchett & Cockburn, 2015), even when they knew the name of what they were looking for
(Teevan, Alvarado, Ackerman, & Karger, 2004), are given improved search engines
(Bergman, Beyth-Marom, Nachmias, et al., 2008), or have not made the effort to maintain
a highly-structured information organisation (Teevan et al., 2004). Users typically search
their files only as a last resort in rare cases when navigation fails (Bergman, Beyth-Marom,
Nachmias, et al., 2008; Fitchett & Cockburn, 2015; Nardi et al., 1995), for example when a
folder structure has become unfamiliar over time (Copié Pucihar, Kljun, Mariani, & Dix
